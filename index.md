## Profile

I got a Bachelor Degree of Statistics and a Master Degree of Management Science and Engineering from [Beihang Univerisity](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn) in 2018 and 2022.

**Since Feb 2022** I am a PhD Student in Energy Forecasting in [Mines Paris | PSL](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu) with the scholarship from China Scholarship Council (CSC).
My supervisor and co-supervisor are [Andrea Michiorri](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/Services/Annuaire/andrea-michiorri) and [Simon Camal](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/Services/Annuaire/simon-camal).


## Research

My research interests are time series forecasting and natural language processing.
Now I'm working on electricity load forecasting integrating with textual features from news or social media.
